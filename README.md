### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am Azmyin, a Doctoral student currently pursuing a Ph.D. program in the Department of MIE at Louisiana State University. 

Here, I am working on finding novel ways of using semantic data extracted from RGB-D images to improve single-agent and multi-agent localization and mapping for robotic systems ðŸ¤–. The project is funded by NSF-NRI grant.

Also presently learning how to use the Open 3D Engine for photorealsitic, physics-based simulation study.
